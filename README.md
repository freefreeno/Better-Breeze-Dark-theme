# Better Breeze Dark theme colors
Just one small color change to the Breeze dark theme makes a world of difference for me
This is the deal.
Some colors just have a grainy look on my PC and it is not a top of the line screen but it is fairly new and it is fairly good.
Let us get this out of the way.
I have 2016 Lenovo Yoga 710 with a 1920x1080 res and Intel HD 620 Graphics running mesa and intel-media-driver
It is not my screen or my laptop.
It is just the color. It is like on some colors the contrast is off or something I have tested enough to know that it is just some 
colors. Breeze Dark theme is one of those colors on my PC and it makes me mad because I like the Breeze dark theme so I changed it just
a little and I mean just a little and guess what it is slick again and looks great but still looks like the Breeze dark theme so I am 
doing this for people out there that may have the same problem but really like the Breeze dark look.
